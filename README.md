## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I am Marinus Retra, a game developer, I make games.

A couple things about me:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently on summer break, doing not that much. (I hope.)
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about game development, or just games in general.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: mwwretra@st.noorderpoort.nl
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: If you take all of someone's blood vessels and lay them out in a straight line, they'll probably die.
